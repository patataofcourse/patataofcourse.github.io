hiiiiiiii

Name's patataofcourse (please don't capitalize it lmao), but you can call me patat, patata, pat, patatatatatatatat, or any variation thereof. Pronouns are they/she/xe!

I'm mainly a 3DS and DS modder, but I dabble in GBA and other Nintendo consoles from time to time. I also ~~waste~~ spend my time looking up various things that interest me, and you'll find commits or issues by me in the randomest of places, honestly.

Most of the things I do are based around coding in Rust in some way or another because I learned Rust in 2021 and I haven't shut up since. Python is also a language I use for smaller stuff, and I got some proficiency in bash scripting (i use arch btw).

If you need anything from me, you can contact me on Discord under `@patataofcourse`. I don't really check anything else, so if you DM me on, like, Tumblr or Reddit, chances are, I'll take five years to answer.
