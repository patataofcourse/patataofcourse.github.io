Modding / making mod tools is a fuck and sometimes it feels like you're working a lot for very little, when the stuff you make only starts get using long-term rather than short term. That, combined with me being a student and not making a lot of money, is why it would really mean a lot if you could drop a couple [[insert currency here]] as a token of appreciation for my work.

You can find my Ko-Fi [here](https://ko-fi.com/patataofcourse) for one-off donations! Feel free to drop some words of support, or to let me know what project of mine you're most invested in :D

I'm also in the process of opening commissions for code patches and tooling - if you're interested, keep an eye out!
